# Numerical Methods and AI Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various numerical methods and artificial intelligence algorithms, including animations to visualize their working.

## Features
- **Finite Element Method (FEM):** Simulates deformation in a 2D mesh.
- **Monte Carlo Method:** Estimates the value of Ï€ using a random sampling technique.
- **Runge Kutta:** Solves the pendulum motion and visualizes energy changes over time.
- **Genetic Algorithm:** Optimizes a function using evolutionary techniques.
- **PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network):** Solves differential equations for pendulum motion.
- **Gradient Descent:** Finds the minimum of a quadratic function.

## Usage
Each algorithm is modularized and can be run independently. Examples for each algorithm are in the `examples/` directory.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples
Run any example script to see the algorithm in action. For example:
```bash
python examples/fem_example.py
```
