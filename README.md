# Numerical Methods and AI Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various numerical methods and artificial intelligence algorithms, including animations to visualize their working.

## About the Project
- **Created by:** [Arslan,Akın](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arslanakin/)
- **Presentation Date:** 20.11.2024
- **Webinar Link:** [Makina MMO Webinar](https://makina.mmo.org.tr/Egitim/13655)

## Features
- **Finite Element Method (FEM):** Simulates rectangle'sdeformation in a 2D mesh.
- **Monte Carlo Method:** Estimates the value of π using a random sampling technique.
- **Runge Kutta:** Solves the pendulum motion and visualizes energy changes over time.
- **Genetic Algorithm:** Finding minimize value of a function=x**2+4*sin(5x)+cos(10x) using evolutionary techniques.
- **PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network):** Solves differential equations for pendulum motion.
- **Gradient Descent:** Finds the minimum of a quadratic function=x**2+4x+4.

## Usage
Each algorithm is modularized and can be run independently. Examples for each algorithm are in the `examples/` directory.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples
Run any example script to see the algorithm in action. For example:
```bash
python examples/fem_example.py
```
